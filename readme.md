## Day Notes

- There are two types of components
    - Class Based Component or Statefull component
        - rules
            - it must be extended from `React.Component`
            - it must have a method called `render()`
        - Notes
            - You can still make a class components without a state in it.
    - Functional Components or Stateless Components
        - When you write a JSX or TSX inside a normal function, it becomes Functional Component.
        - Why we call it stateless? Because it lacks `state` like Class Components
    - When we write component we can decide what type of component should we write by just
    identifying whether this component needs a state or not.
